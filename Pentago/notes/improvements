1. The comparator right now is Win, Heuristics, Draw, and Loss. Win, Draw, Heuristics, and Loss could be better because Draw will establish an upper-bound on the searches.


Try to implement naive minimax and compare an alpha beta result against it
Check resultingGameValue to see if it works properly with minimax, and rename resultingGameValue if needed
Try a more filled 4x4 board and see if it is really returning the right result.
Look at reverse deep pruning
Check the optimizations..



Implement Heuristic Calculator
Benchmark Code to find places to optimize
Fix Move's compareTo and how it relates to the MoveComparator's compareTo


Try iterating row-wise instead of column-wise, as this should yield better performance.
