1. GameState has the wrong ordering of conditionals. There's a negative segfault in one of the conditionals that is never detected because it reads into a local variable instead of into the array.
2. GenerateMoves does NOT add moves that result in a terminal value to the final moves list!
			//We already know this move is a winning move, so add it and continue
	    	if (GameValue.isTerminalValue(currMove.getResultingGameValue())) {
    			uniqueMoves[numMoves] = MoveFactory.createMove(currMove.getIndex(),
						   currMove.getSubBoard(),
						   currMove.getIsClockwise(),
						   currMove.getResultingGameValue());
    			numMoves += 1;
    			continue;
	    	}
3. GenerateMoves should only terminate subBoard 0 if it is a WIN
